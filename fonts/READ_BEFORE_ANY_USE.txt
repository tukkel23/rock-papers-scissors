Roxaine Serif is a bold yet elegant serif typeface, balancing a sense of classical tradition with contemporary sharpness. Its high contrast strokes and distinctive triangular serifs give it a sophisticated presence, while the flowing curves keep it approachable and full of personality. In its Regular style, Roxaine Serif exudes stability and authority, perfect for refined text settings. The Italic version adds an extra dimension of movement and style, leaning gracefully forward with a dynamic flair.

The design draws inspiration from timeless editorial lettering, where thick and thin strokes interplay to create visual rhythm. Its expressive forms make it equally suited for grand headlines or refined branding, always commanding attention without shouting.

The font is built with advanced OpenType functionality and guaranteed top-notch quality, containing stylistic and contextual alternates, ligatures and more automatic and manual features; all to give you full control and customizability. 
It has extensive lingual support, covering all Latin-based languages, from North Europa to South Africa, from America to South-East Asia. It contains all characters and symbols you'll ever need, including all punctuation and numbers. 

Created by Mans Greback, whose lettering expertise blends artistic sensitivity with technical precision, ensuring each curve and detail has purpose and beauty.
